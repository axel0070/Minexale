# CGRAPH 

A 3D graph for the TI-83 Premium CE calculators. It uses <a href="https://github.com/CE-Programming/libraries/releases/latest">CE C 'Standard' Libraries</a>

This program use the math arbitrary precision for the TI-84+ CE calculators <a href="https://github.com/nathanfarlow/PineappleCAS">PineappleCAS</a>

This program is a "proof of concept". It was made for fun, and is no longer supported.

## Examples

<p align="center">
  <b>f(x,y) = cos(sin(x*y))</b><br>
  <img src="https://github.com/axel0070/CGRAPH/blob/master/screnshot/cos(sin(xy))%20P1.png">
</p>

<p align="center">
  <b>f(x,y) = sqrt( |x*y| )</b><br>
  <img src="https://github.com/axel0070/CGRAPH/blob/master/screnshot/sqrt(abs(xy))%20P1.png">
</p>


## How to use

* Download [CGRAPH.8xp](https://github.com/axel0070/CGRAPH/releases/latest).

* Send it to your calculator using TI Connect CE.

* Put your function f(X,Y) in the Y1 section of the default graph of the calculator.

* Launch the program CGRAPH.

* Choose with the keyboard the precision you want, enjoy.

## Issues

* The program don't recognize "forbidden value" it just put 0 at this point.

* Can't move the camera (Not implemented too slow)
